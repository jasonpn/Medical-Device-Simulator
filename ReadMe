The program is a simulation of the The Alpha-Stim CES device.
Implementation and testing are in C++ using the Qt framework in QtCreator.
When run the user is presented with a screen with various buttons.
There are buttons to change the Waveform, frequency, and timer variables,
up/down arrows to change the current (in milliamps), and power button.
There is also a Record button that when activated records the session data when
the device is touching the patient (check the "Apply to Skin" checkbox): the Record
button must be activated when the checkbox is activated to start a recording then
the recording ends when the checkbox is unchecked.

Included Files:
mainwindow.ui, mainwindow.h, mainwindow.cc      - Handles the display. Is a View and Control object.
Device.h, Device.cc                             - Stores the state of the device.
Record.h, Record.cc                             - Stores the data for a recording.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tested scenarios:
    ON/OFF Switch:
    Run the simulator and press the power button.

    Check when electrodes are in contact with skin, pauses, and resumes timer:
    Turn on the device, then check the "apply to skin" checkbox.

    Three frequency options of 0.5Hz, 77Hz, and 100Hz:
    Turn on the device and press the frequency button, observe frequency options on screen.

    Three waveform options of Alpha, Betta, and Gamma:
    Turn on the device and press the waveform button, observe waveform options on screen.

    20, 40 or 60 minutre countdown cycles to auto -off:
    Turn on the device and press the timer button, observer timer options on screen.

    Large timer display. Waveform cycle starts when electrodes touch skin:
    Turn on the device and choose a timer option. Check apply to skin checkbox and observe.

    0 - 500 microampere current control (1-10), +50 when incrementing and -100 when decrementing:
    Turn on device and observe current meter on screen. Press up or down buttons to change current.

    30 minute auto -off when not in use:
    Power on device and wait for shutdown.

    Battery charge indicator. Device issues a warning at 5% charge and shuts down at 2% after another warning:
    Charge battery percentage on the battery percentage spinbox, or use the device until battery is low.

    User can choose to record a therapy and add to history of treatment:
    Starts a session and press the record button.

    Automatically and permanently disables itself should a single fault develop within the device causing the current to exceed 700uA:
    Turn on the device and press the fault checkbox.
